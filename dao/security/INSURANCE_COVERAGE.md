// Risk assessment framework
const riskAssessment = {
  treasuryValue: '$XM',
  assetClasses: {
    stablecoins: { percentage: 0.6, risk: 'Low' },
    eth: { percentage: 0.3, risk: 'Medium' },
    defi: { percentage: 0.1, risk: 'High' }
  },
  threatVectors: {
    smartContractExploit: { probability: 0.02, impact: '$5M' },
    governanceAttack: { probability: 0.05, impact: '$2M' },
    operationalFailure: { probability: 0.1, impact: '$500K' }
  },
  insuranceGap: '$2M', // Amount above self-insurance threshold
  recommendedCoverage: '$10M'
};
