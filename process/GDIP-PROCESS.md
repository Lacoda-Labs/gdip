# GDIP Process (Summary)

This document summarizes how to submit, discuss, and adopt **GeoDistricts Improvement Proposals (GDIPs)**. The **canonical process** is defined in **[GDIP-001: Purpose and Guidelines](../GDIPs/gdip-001-purpose-and-guidelines.md)**. Use that document as the single source of truth for the improvement process.

## Quick reference

- **What is a GDIP**: A numbered, versioned document that defines or extends the GeoDistricts protocol (or the process itself). See [GDIP-001](../GDIPs/gdip-001-purpose-and-guidelines.md).
- **Types**: **Meta** (process, e.g. GDIP-001), **Required** (all implementations MUST implement), **Optional** (implementations MAY implement).
- **Workflow**: Draft → Review → Accepted. See [GDIP-001](../GDIPs/gdip-001-purpose-and-guidelines.md#gdip-workflow).
- **Submit**: Copy [GDIP-TEMPLATE.md](GDIP-TEMPLATE.md), assign next number (check [GDIPs/README.md](../GDIPs/README.md), e.g. GDIP-007), create `gdip-NNN-short-title.md`, open PR, update index.
- **Governance**: [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) — versioning, releases, maintainers.

## Reference Implementation

The [GeoDistricts reference implementation](https://github.com/Lacoda-Labs/geodistricts) implements the protocol. When submitting a GDIP, link to the implementation (file, PR, or tag) that demonstrates or will implement the proposal.
