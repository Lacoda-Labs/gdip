# GeoDistricts Improvement Proposals (GDIPs)

This repository contains the **GeoDistricts Protocol** specification: numbered improvement proposals (GDIPs), process, and governance. The protocol defines how to objectively generate U.S. congressional districts by geographic division of population—no gerrymandering, comparable and auditable results.

Implementers can adopt the protocol independently. This repo is specification and process only; no application code.

## Quick links

- **[GDIP index](GDIPs/README.md)** — List of all GDIPs (Meta, Required, Optional) with status and descriptions.
- **How to submit a GDIP** — [GDIP-001: Purpose and Guidelines](GDIPs/gdip-001-purpose-and-guidelines.md) and [process/GDIP-PROCESS.md](process/GDIP-PROCESS.md).
- **[Reference implementation](https://github.com/Lacoda-Labs/geodistricts)** — Working code that implements the protocol; use it as an example or run it locally.
